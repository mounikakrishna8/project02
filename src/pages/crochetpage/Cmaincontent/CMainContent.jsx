        <h2>What do I need to begin crocheting?</h2>
        <p>
          One of the best things about crocheting is that you don't need a lot
          to get started â€“ you can get by with just two things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Yarn</li>
          <li>Crochet Hook</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, having access to additional tools can make things easier.
          Let's get a little more detailed and then you'll be able to decide
          what's right for you.

    </section>
